No it wasn't my idea to write this. The next two paragraphs weren't even written for this. I was writing the about section for this website of mine. Halfway through, I realised that if I continue writing this, my about page will turn into a 500 line "Chirag's childhood" real quick. So rather a post.

My earliest engagement with programming was in class 7 because of BASIC. Ngl, I hated it. I sucked at it and thought computers ain't my cup of tea.

Fast forward, class 9. I was introduced to JAVA. It was frightening at start. But then during my summer vacations while randomly scrolling through play store, I got an app, **Sololearn**.
I can say, that app made me what I am now (atleast most of it). More because of its community than its learning modules. More from its people and their cool creations than its e**XP**erience points.
After that, my fear diminished. Instead I started loving the process. I remember writing a code to multiply two matrices and that gave me more enjoyment than anything at that time.
Yes, at this point I no more fear coding. The title of the post has expired. I will continue though.
