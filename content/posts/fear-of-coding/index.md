No it wasn't my idea to write this. The next two paragraphs weren't even written for this. I was writing the about section for this website of mine. Halfway through, I realised that if I continue writing this, my about page will turn into a 500 line "Chirag's childhood" real quick. So rather a post.

My earliest engagement with programming was in class 7 because of BASIC. Ngl, I hated it. I sucked at it and thought computers ain't my cup of tea.

Fast forward, class 9. I was introduced to JAVA. It was frightening at start. But then during my summer vacations while randomly scrolling through play store, I got an app, **Sololearn**.
I can say, that app made me what I am now (atleast most of it). More because of its community than its learning modules. More from its people and their cool creations than its e**XP**erience points.
After that, my fear diminished. Instead I started loving the process. I remember writing a code to multiply two matrices and that gave me more enjoyment than anything at that time.
Yes, at this point I no more fear coding. The title of the post has expired. I will continue though.

Everything went on well and good till boards. After that I went on an unknown rather journey termed "JEE".
I loved the new teachers. The first time in my life, I enjoyed going to school. I made friends. In that restricted place, a small world was created.
Regarding coding, it stopped. Completely. Phones and Laptops weren't allowed. Neither taking CS as optional. Yeah you can count this as a 2 year complete break from coding.

Again fast forward 2020. Reached the goal. Fortunately CS. With this, also came diminished enthusiasm in everything. I tried to learn python then C (both half broken). But by then, coding wasn't the only thing I loved. Interest for photography had already started in me by then.

With the start of college, I did code although in a very diminished tone. Ofcourse I got to know about CP. Tried hands there. Tried to go back to a competitive world AGAIN. Slowly, it dawned upon me, I don't enjoy this. The coding yes. The competition no. Well it's very bad considering the whole world is very competitive right now.
But then, can you really fit in a world if you try to fit by doing something you don't like ? I don't think I can. For the second time, I feared coding. In a weaker tone than before, but I did.

This time, no miracle was gonna come. It happened slow. I started exploring different languages. Different projects (not many). Creating these small beautiful things made me happy again. I got my enthusiasm back. This is what gave me tranquility in coding.

I also realised that DSA is much more important than I had initially thought of. And learning them will give me the potential to make better and more functional useful stuff.

Now I don't fear coding. And I hope I am able to maintain this. I enjoy creating useful stuff and I hope I'll be able to continue doing that.
