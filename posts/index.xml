      <description>No it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my idea to write this. The next two paragraphs weren&amp;rsquo;t even written for this. I was writing the about section for this website of mine. Halfway through, I realised that if I continue writing this, my about page will turn into a 500 line &amp;ldquo;Chirag&amp;rsquo;s childhood&amp;rdquo; real quick. So rather a post.
My earliest engagement with programming was in class 7 because of BASIC. Ngl, I hated it.</description>

      <description>Hey there. I started blogging!
I have been thinking about this since a lot. Finally pushed myself and created this. And ofcourse I will change this default theme. PaperMod gives a solid start though. Ok, no more pep talk. Leaving behind a pic I took in my so far only visit to my campus.
