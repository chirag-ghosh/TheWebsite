I tried to learn python then C (both half broken). But by then, coding wasn’t the only thing I loved. Interest for photography had already started in me by then.\nWith the start of college, I did code although in a very diminished tone. Ofcourse I got to know about CP. Tried hands there. Tried to go back to a competitive world AGAIN. Slowly, it dawned upon me, I don’t enjoy this. The coding yes. The competition no. Well it’s very bad considering the whole world is very competitive right now. But then, can you really fit in a world if you try to fit by doing something you don’t like ? I don’t think I can. For the second time, I feared coding. In a weaker tone than before, but I did.\nThis time, no miracle was gonna come. It happened slow. I started exploring different languages. Different projects (not many). Creating these small beautiful things made me happy again. I got my enthusiasm back. This is what gave me tranquility in coding.\nI also realised that DSA is much more important than I had initially thought of. And learning them will give me the potential to make better and more functional useful stuff.\nNow I don’t fear coding. And I hope I am able to maintain this. I enjoy creating useful stuff and I hope I’ll be able to continue doing that.\nSigning off, Chirag \n",
